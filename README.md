ðŸ“Š **README: Financial Analysis Coursework Project**  

ðŸŒŸ Project Overview
This project dives into a detailed financial analysis, focusing on statistical and theoretical concepts to explore stock returns, their properties, and key financial hypotheses. The project provides valuable insights into market behavior and portfolio management through real-world data and statistical tools.

**Key Objectives**

**Exercise 1:**
* Compute daily, monthly, and annual log-returns for a selected stock.
* Test the normality of returns and visualize the results.


**Exercise 2:**
* Calculate the Jarque-Bera (JB) test statistic and p-values for all stocks across daily, monthly, and annual frequencies.
* Compare distributions using boxplots and evaluate aggregational Gaussianity.


**Exercise 3:**
Analyze the S&P 100 index (^OEX) and repeat tasks from Exercise 1.


**Exercise 4:**
* Estimate alpha (Î±) and beta (Î²) for each stock using the Single-Index Model.
* Store results in a DataFrame and visualize distributions with boxplots.


**Exercise 5:**
* Compute the covariance matrix of index components using monthly excess-returns.
* Test the hypothesis that covariance between stocks is proportional to the product of their beta values.
* Visualize and critically discuss the results.


**Applications**
* Applied statistical measures like skewness and kurtosis.
* Used the Single-Index Model to analyze risk and return.
* Critically evaluated relationships between covariance and beta values.
* Improved visualization and interpretation of financial data.
